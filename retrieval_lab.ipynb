    "In this lab we will experiment with basic image and text retrieval. We will be using a subset of the COCO Dataset http://mscoco.org/, a popular dataset these days for many tasks involving images and text. This is a dataset of images with descriptions written by people. We are using a subset of this dataset for this Lab containing 50k images for training, and 10k images for validation/development. Each image is associated with a single image description (However the full dataset contains 5 image descriptions/captions). The images are resized and center-cropped to 256 by 256 pixels. In this lab we will build a simple retrieval system based on image similarities."

We computed the bleu score of the top returned \"candidate\" caption (corresponding to the most similar image) agasint the \"reference\" caption associated with the query image. Compute the average of this score across all images in the validation set. (1pts). <span style=\"color:#555;font-size:0.9em\">Hint: This task only requires in principle writing a for-loop around the code provided in this lab, however this will likely take very long to compute, note that cdist can also compute efficiently the distance between two sets of vectors at once.</span> <br/><br/>\n",

A more robust feature for returning similar images is the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG features). Which uses gradient information (edges) as opposed to color information. Use this feature instead and record here the BLEU score in the entire validation set. Feel free to use the scikit-image package to compute HOG features http://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/auto_examples/plot_hog.html. How does this number compare to the previous two? (2pts) <br/><br/>\n",
